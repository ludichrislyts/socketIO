***Socket.io simple chat room exercise

_taken from a couple tutorials I found online [single chatroom exercise](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) and [multiple room exercise](http://psitsmike.com/2011/10/node-js-and-socket-io-multiroom-chat-tutorial/)_

The first tutorial will walk you through getting set up if you don't already have node.js, express, and/or socket.io on your system.

Once/if you do, just run 
    node index.js
from the root folder of index.js
